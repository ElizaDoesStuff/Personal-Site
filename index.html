      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Eliza, a transfem programmer. (I know, so original) <br>
        When I have free time, I often
          write or play music (piano and mallet percussion),
          play games (celeste is peak),
          or do math (can you tell I'm a nerd yet?) <br>
        I love cats, but dogs are ok. <br>
        My favorite color is green. <br>
        I am 15 years old as of January 21st. <br>
        You cannot follow me on Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter (fuck you, elon), or Bluesky. <br>
        Please don't subscribe to my YouTube channel, I don't post anything on there. Seriously, like, nothing. <br>
        You can email me though; my email is eliza.doesstuff00100@gmail.com!
